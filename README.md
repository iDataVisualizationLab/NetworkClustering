# Algorithms for detecting community structure in networks
In this project, we implement algorithms for detecting community structure in networks. 
Our web application is available at [online demo](https://nvtngan.github.io/)|[back up link](http://hexagon.pe.hu/).

### Exploring Topics and Events in Political Blogs
The following image shows the top 100 terms in nearly 100,000 political blog posts in last 10 years (from 2006 to 2015). Terms are color-coded by clusters (generated by our algorithm). The red dashed slider on the left controls the cut-off value for cluster formation. Terms appear together in the same political blogs are connected by links. The link thickness indicates the frequency of collocated terms.

### Finding Patterns in the IMDB Co-Star Network
The following image shows community structure for the top 100 actors from [IMDB database](http://www.imdb.com/interfaces) in movies rated 8.5 stars or higher. Links connect co-actors in the same movies and color-coded by thier clusters.

### Protein interactions in Biological Pathway Literature
The following image shows community structure for 125 proteins selected from various Pathway Commons index cards. In particular, a link connects two proteins/complexes if they interact. Nodes are colored by community formation.

### Author Collaboration in Visualization Publications
The following image shows collaboration network of the top 100 researchers from [Visualization Publication Data Collection](http://www.vispubdata.org/site/vispubdata/). Links connect authors of the same paper. Link thickness highlights the number of papers that they published together.

### Zachary's Karate Club
The following image shows contains the network of friendships between the 34 members of a karate club at a US university, as described by Wayne Zachary in 1977. Dataset at [UCI Network Data Repository](https://networkdata.ics.uci.edu/data.php?id=105).

### Jazz Musicians network
The following image shows the collaboration network between Jazz musicians.  Each node is a Jazz musician and an edge denotes that two musicians have played together in a band from [Koblenz Network Collection](http://konect.uni-koblenz.de/networks/arenas-jazz).

### American College Football
The following image shows the network of American football games
between Division IA colleges during regular season Fall 2000, as compiled
by M. Girvan and M. Newman. Dataset: [UCI Network Data Repository](https://networkdata.ics.uci.edu/data.php?id=5).
